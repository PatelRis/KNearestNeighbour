# KNearestNeighbour

The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple, easy-to-implement supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used to solve both classification and regression problems. KNN is a model that classifies data points based on the points that are most similar to it. It uses test data to make an “educated guess” on what an unclassified point should be classified as.
